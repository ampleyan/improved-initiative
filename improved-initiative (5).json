His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. **Skull lashers** are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The masters of souls delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

Although small, redcaps have formidable strength.\n\nIn the Feywild, or in places where that plane touches another plane at a fey crossing, one or more redcaps might appear where fresh blood soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny, bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps.\n\nTo sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap must soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. If the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\n**Blood Lust Personified**. In the Feywild, or where that plane touches the world at a fey crossing, if a sentient creature acts on an intense desire for bloodshed, one or more redcaps might appear where the blood of a slain person soaks the ground. At first, new redcaps look like tiny bloodstained mushrooms just pushing their caps out of the soil. When moonlight shines on one of these caps, a creature that looks like a wizened and undersized gnome with a hunched back and a sinewy frame springs from the earth. The creature has a pointed leather cap, pants of similar material, heavy iron boots, and a heavy bladed weapon. From the moment it awakens, a redcap desires only murder and carnage, and it sets out to satisfy these cravings.\n\nRedcaps lack subtlety. They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\n**Steeped in Slaughter**. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\n**Bloodthirsty Mercenaries**. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be found in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\nVARIANT: MADCAPS\n-\n\nA madcap is a redcap that soaks its hat in demon ichor instead of blood. Contact with demon ichor makes the creature even more psychotic, causing it to brood over irrational hatreds. A group of madcaps will sometimes band together over a shared hatred of something, such as music, creatures with curly hair, the word “cool,” or the color blue.\nWhen a madcap drops to 0 hit points, its hateful existence comes to an end in spectacular fashion as it bursts into flames, reducing itself, its ichor-soaked hat, and its pants to ashes instantly while leaving behind its weapon and smoldering iron boots.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. **Reapers** are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the fists of Bane, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The ***black gauntlets*** are the priests who command the consuls.",

It has a thick protective carapace, thin metallic wings, and strong legs ending in swordlike talons. It uses its stinger to inject a chemical admixture similar to alchemist’s fire into its victims. This same solution carries a paralytic enzyme that renders the victim helpless long enough for the hellwasp to grab its prey and flee.\n\nHellwasps thrive in hot weather, but extreme cold causes their shells to crack and their metabolisms to shut down. Consequently, they avoid the icy layers of the Nine Hells (Stygia and Cania).\n\n**Nests**. Hellwasps spew a golden bile similar to amber, which they use to craft enormous nests riddled with chambers and passages. The hellwasps use these nests as communal shelters and food storage. A typical nest is large enough to support a commune of 1d10 + 10 hellwasps, with each hellwasp having an equal voice and role in the society.\n\n**Hellwasp Telepathy**. Hellwasps communicate with one another via a form of telepathy perceptible only to their kind.",

His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The **masters of souls** delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

    "Description": "Zariel\n-\n\nOnce a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel’s passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.\n\nZariel’s “rise” came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.\n\nTo replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils. Only by tempting mortals with power on the Material Plane and striking bargains with them can she bind them to her in the afterlife.\n\nMatalotok. Zariel recently defeated the demon lord Kostchtchie and took his hammer, Matalotok, which grants Zariel immunity to cold damage. Without this hammer, Zariel has resistance to cold damage instead.\n\nZariel’s Lair\n-\n\nZariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold’s wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.\n\n**Lair Actions**. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders’ loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n•Zariel casts her innate fireball spell.\n\n**Regional Effects**. The region containing Zariel’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n•The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.\n\n•Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.\n\n•The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can’t be cleared away.\n\nIf Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nDevils: Archdevils\n-\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy of the Nine Hells stand the archdevils, a vicious and backbiting group made up of the Hells’ elite devils. They include the various lords, the nobles who owe them fealty, and some exiles and outcasts who have fallen out of favor. Favor in the Nine Hells shifts like the wind, and the fortunes of the great and mighty rise and fall at the whims of their betters. Many dread names are included in the rolls of the archdevils; the few described here are among those that adventurers are most likely to encounter.\n\n**Wish Fulfillment**. All devils seek control over mortal souls, so they offer enticements to tempt mortals into making unwise bargains. Archdevils, possessing the true power of the Nine Hells, can fulfill nearly any desire (within the limits of a wish spell) requested by the mortals they bind to their infernal contracts. Archdevils always fulfill the letter of the wish, rewarding desperate mortals with a twisted interpretation of their desires. In exchange for this gift, the devil expects and receives total power over a soul and usually claims it upon the mortal’s death. An archdevil can’t fulfill its own wish.\n\nZariel\n-\n\nZariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane’s corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells.\n\nAll who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes.\n\nGiven her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel’s servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called **night blades**, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. **Skull lashers** are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The masters of souls delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

They live for direct confrontation and the mayhem of mortal combat. Even if a redcap wanted to be stealthy, its iron boots force it to take ponderous, thunderous steps. When a redcap is near to potential prey, though, it can close the distance quickly and get in a vicious swing of its weapon before the target can react.\n\n**Steeped in Slaughter**. To sustain its unnatural existence, a redcap has to soak its hat in the fresh blood of its victims. When a redcap is born, its hat is coated with wet blood, and it knows that if the blood isn’t replenished at least once every three days, the redcap vanishes as if it had never been. A redcap’s desire to slay is rooted in its will to survive.\n\n**Bloodthirsty Mercenaries**. Redcaps don’t usually operate in groups, but in some circumstances they might be found in the employ of hags and dark mages that know methods to call redcaps out of the Feywild and put them to work as grisly servants.\n\nAlso, some redcaps can sense the being whose murderous acts led to their birth. A redcap might use this innate connection to find its creator and make that creature its first victim. Others seek out their maker to enjoy proximity to a kindred spirit. An individual responsible for the creation of multiple redcaps at the same site could attract the entire group to serve as cohorts, emulating that creature’s murderous handiwork.\n\nIn any case, if a redcap works with another being, the redcap demands to be paid in victims. A patron who tries to stifle a redcap’s natural and necessary urge for blood risks becoming the redcap’s next target.\n\nVARIANT: MADCAPS\n-\n\nA madcap is a redcap that soaks its hat in demon ichor instead of blood. Contact with demon ichor makes the creature even more psychotic, causing it to brood over irrational hatreds. A group of madcaps will sometimes band together over a shared hatred of something, such as music, creatures with curly hair, the word “cool,” or the color blue.\nWhen a madcap drops to 0 hit points, its hateful existence comes to an end in spectacular fashion as it bursts into flames, reducing itself, its ichor-soaked hat, and its pants to ashes instantly while leaving behind its weapon and smoldering iron boots.",

Smiler thinks he can accomplish anything with a positive attitude and some death-defying stunt. Although he admits others might end up getting killed by his actions, he believes he can bend the multiverse to his whims if he tries hard enough. He’s really quite insane.\n\nOne of Smiler’s favorite antics is to use a hallucinatory terrain spell to create a little bit of the Feywild in Avernus: a beautiful woodland glade in which to lose himself for a few hours while he meditates and plots.\n\nThis eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth’s warband and their infernal war machines. Smiler’s gang came to be known as Smiler’s Defilers, and their ferocity terrified the other warlords of Avernus for a while.\n\nThree of Smiler’s rivals — Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik — joined forces to wipe out Smiler’s Defilers. Smiler escaped and tears around Avernus on a Devil’s Ride, looking for adventurers willing to help him get revenge on the warlords who ganged up on him.

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. **Reapers** are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the fists of Bane, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The ***black gauntlets*** are the priests who command the consuls.",

    "Description": "Hellwasp\n-\n\nA hellwasp is an intelligent, malevolent insect native to the Nine Hells. It has a thick protective carapace, thin metallic wings, and strong legs ending in swordlike talons. It uses its stinger to inject a chemical admixture similar to alchemist’s fire into its victims. This same solution carries a paralytic enzyme that renders the victim helpless long enough for the hellwasp to grab its prey and flee.\n\nHellwasps thrive in hot weather, but extreme cold causes their shells to crack and their metabolisms to shut down. Consequently, they avoid the icy layers of the Nine Hells (Stygia and Cania).\n\n**Nests**. Hellwasps spew a golden bile similar to amber, which they use to craft enormous nests riddled with chambers and passages. The hellwasps use these nests as communal shelters and food storage. A typical nest is large enough to support a commune of 1d10 + 10 hellwasps, with each hellwasp having an equal voice and role in the society.\n\n**Hellwasp Telepathy**. Hellwasps communicate with one another via a form of telepathy perceptible only to their kind.",

His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The **masters of souls** delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

    "Description": "Zariel\n-\n\nOnce a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, Zariel succumbed to the corrupting influence of the Nine Hells and fell from grace. Asmodeus admired Zariel’s passion for war and offered her rulership of Avernus. She accepted his offer and was transformed by Asmodeus into an archdevil.\n\nZariel’s “rise” came at the expense of Bel, her pit fiend predecessor. Zariel and Bel hate each other. To keep Bel busy and out of her sight, Zariel tasks him with forging weapons, armor, and gruesome demon-slaying machines.\n\nTo replenish her legions, Zariel needs the souls of mortals to create lemures, which she can then promote to higher forms of devils. Only by tempting mortals with power on the Material Plane and striking bargains with them can she bind them to her in the afterlife.\n\nMatalotok. Zariel recently defeated the demon lord Kostchtchie and took his hammer, Matalotok, which grants Zariel immunity to cold damage. Without this hammer, Zariel has resistance to cold damage instead.\n\nZariel’s Lair\n-\n\nZariel makes her lair in a basalt citadel that rises up in Avernus. From nearly a mile away, one can hear the screams and moans coming from the burned victims chained to the stronghold’s wall, the dying remains of those who failed to impress the archdevil. The stronghold, covering five square miles, is surrounded by walls reinforced with high turrets. Devils of all kinds crawl over the structure, ensuring that no intruders breach their defenses.\n\n**Lair Actions**. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•Zariel casts major image four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders’ loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn’t need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\n•Zariel casts her innate fireball spell.\n\n**Regional Effects**. The region containing Zariel’s lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:\n\n•The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.\n\n•Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (2d6) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.\n\n•The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can’t be cleared away.\n\nIf Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nDevils: Archdevils\n-\n\nAt the top of the hierarchy of the Nine Hells stand the archdevils, a vicious and backbiting group made up of the Hells’ elite devils. They include the various lords, the nobles who owe them fealty, and some exiles and outcasts who have fallen out of favor. Favor in the Nine Hells shifts like the wind, and the fortunes of the great and mighty rise and fall at the whims of their betters. Many dread names are included in the rolls of the archdevils; the few described here are among those that adventurers are most likely to encounter.\n\n**Wish Fulfillment**. All devils seek control over mortal souls, so they offer enticements to tempt mortals into making unwise bargains. Archdevils, possessing the true power of the Nine Hells, can fulfill nearly any desire (within the limits of a wish spell) requested by the mortals they bind to their infernal contracts. Archdevils always fulfill the letter of the wish, rewarding desperate mortals with a twisted interpretation of their desires. In exchange for this gift, the devil expects and receives total power over a soul and usually claims it upon the mortal’s death. An archdevil can’t fulfill its own wish.\n\nZariel\n-\n\nZariel rules Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Once a mighty angel charged with watching the tides of the Blood War, she succumbed to the plane’s corrupting influence and fell from grace. She recently reclaimed her position as archdevil of Avernus after the cautious Bel proved inadequate at marshaling his forces to launch offensives against the encroaching demons. Now Bel advises her and helps her manage the war, though many whisper that her true agenda is vengeance against Asmodeus, and her true plan is to drive him from the Nine Hells.\n\nAll who enter and exit the Nine Hells must pass through Avernus, so the infernal armies muster on this layer. Here, the amnizus guard the citadels overlooking the River Styx, much of the fighting of the Blood War takes place, and devils gather to invade the Abyss. Anyone hoping to reach the lower layers must first contend with the darkness of this layer and the myriad threats it houses. Zariel manages it all and has the ultimate say over who comes and goes.\n\nGiven her role in the Blood War, Zariel is keenly interested in collecting souls from the greatest warriors on the Material Plane and securing their loyalty. She bargains hard, and mortals end up worse for dealing with her, because she holds all the cards. A bargain with Zariel is eternal; there is little hope of wriggling out of it. However, she does expect the best from her servants, and so she allows her mortal followers to live out their lives, ever honing their talents, so she can put them to the best use when she finally calls in their debts. As a result, Zariel’s servants are universally effective, disciplined, and dangerous.",

They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

In general, she has no problem with adventurers and will do her utmost to help them deal with the myriad threats lurking in the jungle.\n\n-\n\nLiara comes from an influential family in Baldur’s Gate and has held her post for the past three years. To her, the assignment feels like a test of mettle, but to many of her subordinates, Fort Beluarian feels like banishment. Liara’s spies in Port Nyanzaru furnish her with ship manifests and departure schedules that she passes along to the pirates of Jahaka Anchorage, in exchange for promises to never attack ships flying the flag of Baldur’s Gate. Liara also receives a cut of the pirates’ profits, some of which go toward keeping her garrison happy.\n\n-\n\n***Liara Portyr’s Traits***\n\n**Ideal.** “One must respect the chain of command. You follow my orders, or you die.”\n\n**Bond.** “I have sworn to hold and protect Fort Beluarian in the name of Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard of Baldur’s Gate.

    "Description": "Mahadi the Rakshasa\n-\n\nMahadi appears as a wealthy merchant lord. Though extremely powerful, Mahadi doesn’t believe in taking unnecessary risks, particularly in the Nine Hells where he can be permanently slain. Mahadi acts as the eyes and ears of Asmodeus in Avernus. As a deal broker and moderator, he’s privy to all manner of dealings that might otherwise escape the attention of his patron.\n\nIn his role as the master of the Wandering Emporium, Mahadi has received special dispensation from Asmodeus to travel freely between the Material Plane and the Nine Hells to operate his business, as well as to pursue information and broker contracts and other such arrangements as needed.\n\nIn addition to managing the Wandering Emporium, Mahadi is also the proprietor and host of Infernal Rapture, a restaurant and spa. Since the establishment exists within a demiplane, patrons can comfortably visit it at any time, even while the caravan is on the move. As long as they can pay for services rendered, guests need not fear being trapped within, since Mahadi is very serious about maintaining the contract between host and guest. Each guest must agree to this formal arrangement prior to gaining entrance.\n\nMahadi presents himself as a charismatic and gracious host. He makes each guest of Infernal Rapture feel as though they’re the most important person in all the planes of existence, catering to their every whim and desire. While he is equally cordial to all guests of the Wandering Emporium, those entering his establishment fall under a special contract and therefore rank most highly in his esteem.\n\nOf course, guests leaving Infernal Rapture are expected to pay their bills in full prior to departure. If a guest cannot pay for whatever reason, the contract they signed on entry clearly stipulates their soul is forfeit. They’re required to pay off their debt through service. All such individuals fall under the effect of a geas cast as a 9th-level spell, which cannot be willingly broken by the affected individual until their debt is paid in full. What Mahadi does with such defaulters depends on their capabilities. Some become indentured servants, working at Infernal Rapture. If they possess a talent for sales, they might eventually obtain a business to run within the Wandering Emporium.",

Narzugons roam across the infernal layers and other planes of existence to carry out the will of their masters.\n\nEvery narzugon claims a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) as its mount. The nightmare is bound by infernal tack and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n\n**Death in Hellfire**. A narzugon’s lances are forged in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of both the narzugon and its master.\n\n**Nightmare Riders**. Each narzugon claims a nightmare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by infernal tack (see the sidebar) and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n \nMAGIC ITEM: INFERNAL TACK\n-\n\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)\n\nA narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.\n\nYou can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.\n\nThe tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.",

Keene’s leadership over the years earned her a reputation of thoughtful pragmatism. When necessary, she seeks revenge for offenses against the Guild—provided doing so is profitable. Her methods are vicious when necessary, and she is as feared as she is respected.\n\nKeene has become increasingly intolerant of the populous tide turning against her organization. While the occasional rabble-rouser has always impeded criminal business, the rise of organized crews and vigilantes is interfering with Guild operations. After a carefully coordinated attack on a patriar’s estate fell to pieces when a vigilante clumsily alerted the estate guards, Keene declared open season on do-gooders of all stripes.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called **night blades**, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Yeenoghu\n-\n\nThe demon lord Yeenoghu, also known as the Beast of Butchery and the Gnoll Lord, appears as a battle-scarred gnoll towering 14 feet tall. He has matted fur covered with patchwork armor made from discarded shields and breastplates held together by chains and decorated by the flayed skin of his fiercest foes. His face is like a grinning predator’s skull.\n\nWhen Yeenoghu hunted across the Material Plane, packed of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate his kills became gnolls, emulating their master’s ways. Few others worship Yeenoghu, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched over, and filing their teeth down to points.\n\nYeenoghu wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth.\n\nIf Yeenoghu is killed anywhere other than the Abyss, he re-forms at full strength in the mansion of rotting meat and bones he calls home on his desolate, canyon-pocked layer of the Abyss.\n\nThe Beast of Butchery appears as a great battle-scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate of great Yeenoghu’s kills became gnolls, emulating their master’s ways. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched over, and filing their teeth down to points.\n\nYeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. The gnolls are his instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name. Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn’t parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him — unless he becomes bored. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.\n\nThe Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and taut, leathery hide, his face like a grinning predator’s skull. Patchwork armor made of discarded shields and breastplates is lashed onto his body with heavy chains, decorated by the flayed skins of his foes. He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth.\n\nYeenoghu’s Lair\n-\n\nYeenoghu’s lair in the Abyss is called the Death Dells, its barren hills and ravines serving as one great hunting ground, where he pursues captured mortals in a cruel game. Yeenoghu’s lair is a place of blood and death, populated by gnolls, hyenas, and ghouls, and there are few structures or signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\n•Yeenoghu causes an iron spike—5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter—to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition.\n\n•Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed.\n\n•Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them.\n\nRegional Effects\n-\n\nThe region containing Yeenoghu’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\n•Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes.\n\n•Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter.\n\n•If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Yeenoghu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can’t be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.\n\nIf Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nMadness of Yeenoghu\n-\n\nIf a creature goes mad in Yeenoghu’s lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Yeenoghu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more on madness.\n\n**Madness of Yeenoghu**\n\nd100   Flaw (lasts until cured)\n\n01–20\n\n“I get caught up in the flow of anger, and try to stoke others around me into forming an angry mob.”\n\n21–40\n\n“The flesh of other intelligent creatures is delicious!”\n\n41–60\n\n“I rail against the laws and customs of civilization, attempting to return to a more primitive time.”\n\n61–80\n\n“I hunger for the deaths of others, and am constantly starting fights in the hope of seeing bloodshed.”\n\n81–00\n\n“I keep trophies from the bodies I have slain, turning them into adornments.”",

These blind, bloated least devils shuffle mindlessly across the Nine Hells, groping for whatever scraps of fetid matter they can scoop into their groaning mouths.\n\nNo soul is turned away from the Nine Hells, but the truly worthless — those whose evil acts in life arose from carelessness and sloth more than anything else — are suitable only to become nupperibos. These pitiful creatures shuffle mindlessly across the landscape: blind, bloated from unquenchable hunger, and groping for whatever scraps of fetid matter or swarming vermin they can scoop into their groaning mouths.\n\n**Nauseating Bulk**. Individually, nupperibos are pathetic, but they’re rarely alone and can be dangerous when gathered into packs. They herd together into throngs that can clog a vital passage or an entire valley. Clouds of stinging insects, stirges, and other vermin surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that torments any non-devil that draws near.\n\n**Hunger Unending**. A nupperibo knows nothing but the hunger that propels it on a blind quest for anything to devour. Once it senses a potential meal, it pursues that prey tirelessly until the food is consumed, the nupperibo is slain, or some other morsel crosses the fiend’s path and distracts it.\n\n**Slavish Obedience**. With no interest of its own beyond the need to consume, a nupperibo obeys unthinkingly any command it receives telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general’s status.\n\nA lemure emerges from the Styx wiped of memory, yet the patterns of evil it performed in life remain indelibly inscribed upon its soul. Those who lacked ambition cannot climb the hierarchical ladder of the Hells. They instead step down, becoming nupperibos.",

    "Description": "Baphomet\n-\n\nThe demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and others with savage hearts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures. Over time, Baphomet’s cultists become tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur — considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.\n\nBaphomet appears as a great, black-furred minotaur 20 feet tall with six iron horns. A hateful light burns in his red eyes. He wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver, but sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside so that he can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, trampling them into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.\n\nIf Baphomet is killed anywhere other than the Abyss, he re-forms at full strength in the great, blood-spattered labyrinth that spans his layer of the Abyss.\n\nDescription\n-\n\nCivilization is weakness and savagery is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He rules over minotaurs and others with savage hearts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most savage desires.\n\nCults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems, creating secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.\n\nOver time, Baphomet’s cultists become tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur—considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.\n\nBaphomet himself appears as a great, black-furred minotaur, 20 feet tall with six iron horns. An infernal light burns in his red eyes. Although filled with bestial bloodlust, there lies within a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all of civilization.\n\nBaphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside so that he can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, trampling them into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.\n\nBaphomet’s Lair\n-\n\nBaphomet’s lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nestled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of a three-dimensional maze. The palace itself is a towering structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane on which it resides, populated by minotaurs, goristros, and quasits.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet creates this effect again.\n\n•Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he’s in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.\n\n•Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no longer in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20.\n\nRegional Effects\n-\n\nThe region containing Baphomet’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\n•Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.\n\n•Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.\n\n•If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Baphomet table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can’t be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.\n\nIf Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nMadness of Baphomet\n-\n\nIf a creature goes mad in Baphomet’s lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Baphomet table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more on madness.\n\n**Madness of Baphomet**\n\nd100 - Flaw (lasts until cured)\n\n01–20\t“My anger consumes me. I can’t be reasoned with when my rage has been stoked.”\n\n21–40\t“I degenerate into beastly behavior, seeming more like a wild animal than a thinking being.”\n\n41–60\t“The world is my hunting ground. Others are my prey.”\n\n61–80\t“Hate comes easily to me and explodes into rage.”\n\n81–00\t“I see those who oppose me not as people, but as beasts meant to be preyed upon.”",

    "Description": "Narzugon\n-\n\nPaladins who make deals with devils and carry their twisted sense of honor into the afterlife are especially valuable to the archdukes of the Nine Hells. Narzugons roam across the infernal layers and other planes of existence to carry out the will of their masters.\n\nEvery narzugon claims a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) as its mount. The nightmare is bound by infernal tack and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n\n**Death in Hellfire**. A narzugon’s lances are forged in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of both the narzugon and its master.\n\n**Nightmare Riders**. Each narzugon claims a nightmare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by infernal tack (see the sidebar) and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n \nMAGIC ITEM: INFERNAL TACK\n-\n\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)\n\nA narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.\n\nYou can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.\n\nThe tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.",

White abishais are the weakest. They fight with reckless fury on the battlefield.\n\nEach abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat’s favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells.\n\n**Emissaries of Doom**. Tiamat deploys abishais as emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyalty to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.\n\n**Outsiders in Hell**. Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat’s orders or Asmodeus’s. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus’s plans invites certain destruction.\n\n***White Abishai***\n\nThough they are the least of their kind, white abishais fight with a reckless fury, making them ideally suited for bolstering the ranks of Tiamat’s armies. White abishais fight without fear, becoming whirlwinds of destruction on the battlefield.",

One promotion after another followed until she was named Master of Drains and Underways. By then, she had been married three times and given birth to three sons. Her lifelong goal has been to lift herself and her family out of the sewers and into high society.\n\nYears of political dealing, blame shuffling, and bribery paid off when Thalamra was elected to the Council of Four. Although she has served on the council for the shortest amount of time, Duke Vanthampur is easily the most politically savvy council member. She speaks little during meetings of the council, preferring to further her political agenda through meetings in her private offices and at her family estate. When she does choose to debate, she speaks with a strength beyond what it seems like her age should allow, and is known for leveling insults that land unsettlingly close to (supposedly) hidden truths.\n\nThalamra Vanthampur is a cunning, devil-worshiping beast of a woman in her late sixties who can stare down a hell hound without flinching. She is barrel-bodied, with strong hands and forearms that speak to her beginnings as a manual laborer. Her youth was spent in the cellars and sewers of Baldur’s Gate, repairing pipes and clearing out the city’s filth. Thalamra rose from such lowly work to become the minister of the city’s sewers and waterworks. Now she dresses in the finery that suits her station as a duke of Baldur’s Gate.",

Ravengard used his military position and influence to secure for himself a seat on the Council of Four. Following the deaths of two council members amid a cloud of corruption and scandal, he persuaded the Parliament of Peers to back his election to grand duke.\n\nUpon ascending to the highest position in the city government, Ravengard refused to relinquish command of the Flaming Fist, making him the most powerful figure in the city by far. This decision has not endeared him to anyone, but Ravengard could care less about his popularity. His only concerns are the stability and prosperity of Baldur’s Gate, and he doesn’t trust any of the other dukes or anyone in the Parliament of Peers to put the city’s interests before their own.\n\nRavengard rose to grand duke on a platform largely backed by idealistic commoners and enemies of the other established dukes. While he won election handily, Ravengard has struggled in performing his duties, finding his hands tied at every turn by both overt and invisible bureaucracy. Despite this, he’s been a voice of reason and common sense on the Council of Four — if not the egalitarianism some hoped. He’s also proven largely resistant to scandal and corruption, though many of his fellow dukes and those in the Parliament of Peers still regularly outmaneuver him politically. One of his only obvious pleasures remains the surprise inspections he regularly visits upon the troops at Wyrm’s Rock.\n\nRavengard was recently tricked into attending a diplomatic summit in Elturel, unaware that his political enemies in Baldur’s Gate orchestrated this meeting in a fiendish plot to remove him from power. In his absence, the Flaming Fist is leaderless, the council rudderless.",

    "Description": "Demons\n-\n\nIncarnations of chaos and evil, demons display endless variation in appearance and in how they go about wreaking havoc across the multiverse.\n\nSibriex\n-\n\nThought to be as old as the Abyss itself, sibriexes haunt remote parts of the plane, where they use their vile abilities to breed new horrors and apprehend forbidden lore. Rivulets of blood and bile cascade from a sibriex’s body. Where these noxious fluids hit the ground, the landscape becomes polluted.\n\n**Keepers of Forbidden Lore**. Sibriexes have spent eons amassing information from across the planes, hoarding knowledge for when it might be useful. Such is their incredible intellect that many seek them out, including demon lords. Some sibriexes act as advisors and oracles, manipulating demons into serving their ends, while other sibriexes cling to their secrets, parceling out lore only when doing so would advance their plans.\n\n**Demon Crafters**. Sibriexes can channel the power of the Abyss to create new demons from other creatures. Over the course of days, they can create vast numbers of rutterkins to protect their lands and to ensure that the plane teems with destructive monsters. Some demons petition sibriexes for physical gifts, and if they are moved to do so, sibriexes can graft on new body parts to give the demons greater strength, vision, or stamina. Sibriexes never give aid freely; they demand a service or a treasure in return for the flesh-shaping they provide.\n\nVariant: Flesh Warping\n-\n\nCreatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex’s Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.\n\nA creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.\n\n*No creature embodies the chaotic nature of the Abyss so well as the sibriex. Although the realm of the demons is already a place of infinite horrors, sibriexes for some reason make even more of these monstrosities.*\n\n***Flesh Warping***\n\n**EFFECT**\n\n01–05\tThe color of the target’s hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.\n\n06–10\tThe target’s eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks.\n\n11–15\tThe target’s hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.\n\n16–20\tOne of the target’s legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.\n\n21–25\tThe target’s eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.\n\n26–30\tA pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target’s back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.\n\n31–35\tThe target’s ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is deafened.\n\n36–40\tTwo of the target’s teeth turn into tusks.\n\n41–45\tThe target’s skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).\n\n46–50\tThe target’s arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.\n\n51–55\tThe target’s arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.\n\n56–60\tThe target’s legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.\n\n61–65\tThe target grows a whiplike tail, which it can use as a whip.\n\n66–70\tThe target’s eyes turn black, and it gains darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\n71–75\tThe target swells, tripling its weight.\n\n76–80\tThe target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.\n\n81–85\tThe target’s head doubles in size.\n\n86–90\tThe target’s ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.\n\n91–95\tThe target’s body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\n96–00\tThe target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or stunned.",

His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. **Necromites** are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The masters of souls delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

    "Description": "Feonor\n-\n\nFeonor is a willowy, neutral evil archmage with milky-white eyes and a parasol made of bones and human flesh. Her rivals know her as a powerful necromancer. They suspect that she fled the Material Plane to escape some horrible fate, but the truth is she was invited to Avernus by Mahadi, the rakshasa master of the Wandering Emporium (see \"The Wandering Emporium\"). During a visit to Feonor’s world, Mahadi fell head-over-heels in love with her zombie-like indifference. Not long after arriving in Avernus, Feonor grew bored of Mahadi’s attempts to impress her. Without so much as a farewell, she took to the Avernian wastes on one of the rakshasa’s infernal war machines and never looked back. Years later, Mahadi still refers to her as “the one the got away.”\n\nThe scowl on Feonor’s face hints at her constant annoyance with the multiverse around her. She prefers not to speak, and when she does, it’s typically only in whispers, her short sentences interspersed and punctuated with frustrated sighs.\n\n**Golden Doom**\nFeonor rides around in a Demon Grinder called Golden Doom, so named because Mahadi fitted it with gilded death armor (see \"Gilded Death Armor\"). The vehicle is driven by a ghast, and its other stations are operated by ghouls. She also commands a force of ten crawling claws. A pair of Tormentors crewed by mezzoloths provide escort.\n\nArchmage\n-\n\nArchmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice their magic without interruption. An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage interlopers.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the **death’s heads**, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the fists of Bane, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by ***iron consuls***, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

Her body also had traits in common with a wyvern, including a long tail tipped with a poisonous stinger.\n\nShe also had three main avatars. The Dark Lady was a mulan female with long dark hair and completely black eyes. She always wore dark robes and frequently had a seductive smile on her face.\n\nThe Chromatic Dragon was a dragon with stubby legs and five heads that could be any combination of head belonging to a chromatic dragon, the skin of each merged into three stripes -- blue-green, gray and purple before they merged again into brown skin that covered her tail. Sometimes, The Chromatic Dragon appeared in the form of Tchazzar when manifesting in Chessenta. The Undying Queen was a dracolich version of The Chromatic Dragon.\n\nTiamat had three manifestations in Avernus as well, one of which never left the gate to Dis. Her manifestation as Azharul was her other 'public' face used for when foes challenged her to combat, meanwhile her original body remained secluded in her lair.",

Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target’s turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\n\t \n3. Basket of Centipedes. The kobold throws a small basket into a S-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (centipedes) with 11 hit points emerges from the basket and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm’s turns, there's a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.\n\t \n4. Green Slime Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot full of green slime at the target, and it breaks open on impact. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: The target is covered in a patch of green slime (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide). Miss: A patch of green slime covers a randomly determined S-foot-square section of wall or floor within 5 feet of the target.\n\t \n5. Rot Grub Pot. The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact. A swarm of rot grubs (see appendix A) emerges from the shattered pot and remains a hazard in that square.\n\t \n6. Scorpion on a Stick. The kobold makes a melee attack with a scorpion tied to the end of a 5-foot-long pole. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\t \n7. Skunk in a Cage. The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it. The target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target retches and can’t take actions for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that doesn’t need to breathe or is immune to poison automatically succeeds on the saving throw. Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.\n\t \n8. Wasp Nest in a Bag. The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it. A swarm of insects (wasps) with 11 hit points emerges from the bag and rolls initiative. At the end of each of the swarm's turns, there’s a 50 percent chance that the swarm disperses.",

Narzugons roam across the infernal layers and other planes of existence to carry out the will of their masters.\n\nEvery narzugon claims a nightmare (described in the Monster Manual) as its mount. The nightmare is bound by infernal tack and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n\n**Death in Hellfire**. A narzugon’s lances are forged in hellfire. The soul of anyone killed by such a lance is shunted to the River Styx for rebirth as a lemure. Each lance is unique to its owner, bearing the marks of both the narzugon and its master.\n\n**Nightmare Riders**. Each narzugon claims a nightmare as its mount. These nightmares are bound by infernal tack (see the sidebar) and must respond to summons and commands from the wearer of the spurs.\n \nMAGIC ITEM: INFERNAL TACK\n-\n\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil alignment)\n\nA narzugon binds a nightmare to its service with infernal tack, which consists of a bridle, bit, reins, saddle, stirrups, and spurs. A nightmare equipped with infernal tack must serve whoever wears the spurs until the wearer dies or the tack is removed.\n\nYou can use an action to call a nightmare equipped with infernal tack by clashing the spurs together or scraping them through blood. The nightmare appears at the start of your next turn, within 20 feet of you. It acts as your ally and takes its turn on your initiative count. It remains for 1 day, until you or it dies, or until you dismiss it as an action. If the nightmare dies, it reforms in the Nine Hells within 24 hours, after which you can summon it again.\n\nThe tack doesn’t conjure a nightmare from thin air; one must first be subdued so the tack can be placed on it. No nightmare accepts this forced servitude willingly, but some eventually form strong loyalties to their masters and become true partners in evil.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called **night blades**, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Yeenoghu\n-\n\nThe demon lord Yeenoghu, also known as the Beast of Butchery and the Gnoll Lord, appears as a battle-scarred gnoll towering 14 feet tall. He has matted fur covered with patchwork armor made from discarded shields and breastplates held together by chains and decorated by the flayed skin of his fiercest foes. His face is like a grinning predator’s skull.\n\nWhen Yeenoghu hunted across the Material Plane, packed of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate his kills became gnolls, emulating their master’s ways. Few others worship Yeenoghu, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched over, and filing their teeth down to points.\n\nYeenoghu wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth.\n\nIf Yeenoghu is killed anywhere other than the Abyss, he re-forms at full strength in the mansion of rotting meat and bones he calls home on his desolate, canyon-pocked layer of the Abyss.\n\nThe Beast of Butchery appears as a great battle-scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake. Those that ate of great Yeenoghu’s kills became gnolls, emulating their master’s ways. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunched over, and filing their teeth down to points.\n\nYeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. The gnolls are his instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name. Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn’t parlay; to meet him is to do battle with him — unless he becomes bored. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.\n\nThe Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and taut, leathery hide, his face like a grinning predator’s skull. Patchwork armor made of discarded shields and breastplates is lashed onto his body with heavy chains, decorated by the flayed skins of his foes. He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his bare hands before ripping out its throat with his teeth.\n\nYeenoghu’s Lair\n-\n\nYeenoghu’s lair in the Abyss is called the Death Dells, its barren hills and ravines serving as one great hunting ground, where he pursues captured mortals in a cruel game. Yeenoghu’s lair is a place of blood and death, populated by gnolls, hyenas, and ghouls, and there are few structures or signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Yeenoghu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.\n\n•Yeenoghu causes an iron spike—5 feet tall and 1 inch in diameter—to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 100 feet of him. Any creature in the space where the spike emerges must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 27 (6d8) piercing damage and is restrained by being impaled on the spike. A creature can use an action to remove itself (or a creature it can reach) from the spike, ending the restrained condition.\n\n•Each gnoll or hyena that Yeenoghu can see can use its reaction to move up to its speed.\n\n•Until the next initiative count 20, all gnolls and hyenas within the lair are enraged, causing them to have advantage on melee weapon attack rolls and causing attack rolls to have advantage against them.\n\nRegional Effects\n-\n\nThe region containing Yeenoghu’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\n•Within 1 mile of the lair, large iron spikes grow out of the ground and stone surfaces. Yeenoghu impales the bodies of the slain on these spikes.\n\n•Predatory beasts within 6 miles of the lair become unusually savage, killing far more than what they need for food. Carcasses of prey are left to rot in an unnatural display of wasteful slaughter.\n\n•If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Yeenoghu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can’t be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.\n\nIf Yeenoghu dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nMadness of Yeenoghu\n-\n\nIf a creature goes mad in Yeenoghu’s lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Yeenoghu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more on madness.\n\n**Madness of Yeenoghu**\n\nd100   Flaw (lasts until cured)\n\n01–20\n\n“I get caught up in the flow of anger, and try to stoke others around me into forming an angry mob.”\n\n21–40\n\n“The flesh of other intelligent creatures is delicious!”\n\n41–60\n\n“I rail against the laws and customs of civilization, attempting to return to a more primitive time.”\n\n61–80\n\n“I hunger for the deaths of others, and am constantly starting fights in the hope of seeing bloodshed.”\n\n81–00\n\n“I keep trophies from the bodies I have slain, turning them into adornments.”",

These pitiful creatures shuffle mindlessly across the landscape: blind, bloated from unquenchable hunger, and groping for whatever scraps of fetid matter or swarming vermin they can scoop into their groaning mouths.\n\n**Nauseating Bulk**. Individually, nupperibos are pathetic, but they’re rarely alone and can be dangerous when gathered into packs. They herd together into throngs that can clog a vital passage or an entire valley. Clouds of stinging insects, stirges, and other vermin surround them in a terrifying, reeking sheath that torments any non-devil that draws near.\n\n**Hunger Unending**. A nupperibo knows nothing but the hunger that propels it on a blind quest for anything to devour. Once it senses a potential meal, it pursues that prey tirelessly until the food is consumed, the nupperibo is slain, or some other morsel crosses the fiend’s path and distracts it.\n\n**Slavish Obedience**. With no interest of its own beyond the need to consume, a nupperibo obeys unthinkingly any command it receives telepathically from another devil. This blind loyalty makes them the easiest of infernal troops to lead into battle, but their presence in a legion does nothing to elevate its general’s status.\n\nA lemure emerges from the Styx wiped of memory, yet the patterns of evil it performed in life remain indelibly inscribed upon its soul. Those who lacked ambition cannot climb the hierarchical ladder of the Hells. They instead step down, becoming nupperibos.",

He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures. Over time, Baphomet’s cultists become tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur — considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.\n\nBaphomet appears as a great, black-furred minotaur 20 feet tall with six iron horns. A hateful light burns in his red eyes. He wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver, but sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside so that he can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, trampling them into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.\n\nIf Baphomet is killed anywhere other than the Abyss, he re-forms at full strength in the great, blood-spattered labyrinth that spans his layer of the Abyss.\n\nDescription\n-\n\nCivilization is weakness and savagery is strength in the credo of Baphomet, the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts. He rules over minotaurs and others with savage hearts. He is worshiped by those who want to break the confines of civility and unleash their bestial natures, for Baphomet envisions a world without restraint, where creatures live out their most savage desires.\n\nCults devoted to Baphomet use mazes and complex knots as their emblems, creating secret places to indulge themselves, including labyrinths of the sort their master favors. Bloodstained crowns and weapons of iron and brass decorate their profane altars.\n\nOver time, Baphomet’s cultists become tainted by his influence, gaining bloodshot eyes and coarse, thickening hair. Small horns eventually sprout from the forehead. In time, a devoted cultist might transform entirely into a minotaur—considered the greatest gift of the Prince of Beasts.\n\nBaphomet himself appears as a great, black-furred minotaur, 20 feet tall with six iron horns. An infernal light burns in his red eyes. Although filled with bestial bloodlust, there lies within a cruel and cunning intellect devoted to subverting all of civilization.\n\nBaphomet wields a great glaive called Heartcleaver. He sometimes casts this deadly weapon aside so that he can charge his enemies and gore them with his horns, trampling them into the earth and rending them with his teeth like a beast.\n\nBaphomet’s Lair\n-\n\nBaphomet’s lair is his palace, the Lyktion, which is on the layer of the Abyss called the Endless Maze. Nestled within the twisting passages of the plane-wide labyrinth, the Lyktion is immaculately maintained and surrounded by a moat constructed in the fashion of a three-dimensional maze. The palace itself is a towering structure whose interior is as labyrinthine as the plane on which it resides, populated by minotaurs, goristros, and quasits.\n\n**Lair Actions**\n\nOn initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:\n\n•Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet creates this effect again.\n\n•Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he’s in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.\n\n•Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no longer in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20.\n\nRegional Effects\n-\n\nThe region containing Baphomet’s lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:\n\n•Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.\n\n•Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become frightened and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.\n\n•If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Baphomet table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can’t be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.\n\nIf Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.\n\nMadness of Baphomet\n-\n\nIf a creature goes mad in Baphomet’s lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Baphomet table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more on madness.\n\n**Madness of Baphomet**\n\nd100 - Flaw (lasts until cured)\n\n01–20\t“My anger consumes me.

Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them but rarely do so, since it is never clear the extent of Tiamat’s influence over the creatures.\n\nThere are five kinds of abishai, each one reflective of one of Tiamat’s dragon heads (black, blue, green, red, and white). White abishais are the weakest. They fight with reckless fury on the battlefield.\n\nEach abishai was once a mortal who somehow won Tiamat’s favor before death and, as a reward, found its soul transformed into a hideous devil to serve at her pleasure in the Nine Hells.\n\n**Emissaries of Doom**. Tiamat deploys abishais as emissaries, sending them to represent her interests in the Hells and across the multiverse. Some have simple tasks, such as delivering a message to cultists or taking charge of worshipers to carry out a sensitive mission. Others have greater responsibilities, such as leading large groups, assassinating targets, and serving in armies. In all cases, abishais are fanatically loyalty to Tiamat, ready to lay down their lives if needed.\n\n**Outsiders in Hell**. Abishais stand outside the normal hierarchy of the Nine Hells, having their own chain of command and ultimately answering to Tiamat (and Asmodeus, when the dark lord chooses to use them). Other archdevils can command abishais to work for them, but most archdevils do so rarely, since it is never clear whether an abishai follows Tiamat’s orders or Asmodeus’s. There is inherent risk in countermanding an order given by Tiamat, but interfering with Asmodeus’s plans invites certain destruction.\n\n***White Abishai***\n\nThough they are the least of their kind, white abishais fight with a reckless fury, making them ideally suited for bolstering the ranks of Tiamat’s armies. White abishais fight without fear, becoming whirlwinds of destruction on the battlefield.",

    "Description": "Myrkul and His Followers\n-\n\nMyrkul is the Lord of Bones, claiming power over corpses and souls. His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. **Necromites** are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The masters of souls delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

    "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the **death’s heads**, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

    "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the fists of Bane, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by ***iron consuls***, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the fists of Bane, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by ***iron consuls***, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Myrkul and His Followers\n-\n\nMyrkul is the Lord of Bones, claiming power over corpses and souls. His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The **masters of souls** delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

His cultists are those who seek to claim lore, power, and even fealty from the deceased.\n\nMyrkul has the power to call forth the soul of any slain creature and bind it into a wax skull. Myrkul can use this ability only if he claims some part of a creature’s physical body, grinds it up, and creates a skull that includes the resulting dust. So long as the soul remains inside the skull, the skull’s eye sockets burn with cold blue flames. While the skull is intact, Myrkul can compel the soul trapped within to answer his questions and share its knowledge. The skull degrades with each service rendered, eventually collapsing and releasing the soul. The soul can also be released by dousing the wax skull with holy water.\n\nMyrkul is calculating, distant, and self-centered. He cares only for the acquisition of knowledge and finds that managing the daily affairs of life is at best a tedious distraction. He is happiest when surrounded by his tomes of lore and the undead he has called forth to do his bidding.\n\nThose who follow Myrkul are either wizards or those who seek to master the necromantic arts.\n\n**Delvers into Lore**. Cultists of Myrkul study rituals that allow them to force the souls of the dead into service, compelling them to answer questions and share forgotten lore. They seek out arcane secrets in ancient ruins, and attempt to steal spellbooks and other tomes from wizards outside of the cult.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. A follower of Myrkul wields a flail that has a skull replacing the normal flail’s striking head. Necromites are initiates who have not yet mastered arcane magic and rely on their flails in battle. Skull lashers are spellcasters who use magic to augment their combat abilities. The **masters of souls** delve deep into Myrkul’s secrets, allowing them to animate the dead and perform other grave magic.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power. His charisma is such that he can sway the mighty to pledge their loyalty to him in return for power over others. He finds the hunger for power that exists in every mortal heart and awakens it with carefully crafted promises and flattery. He is the mastermind of the Dead Three, the one whose ambitions drive the group’s efforts.\n\nBane’s devoted followers are warriors who seek to rule through martial strength and intimidation, cruel tyrants who use threats and gifts as needed to ensure loyalty. They enslave those too weak to resist them and shower the strong with gifts and promises of power to turn them into loyal vassals.\n\n**Cruel Tyrants**. Whenever Bane’s followers gain power, they institute draconian measures to ensure that their rule is unquestioned. They stamp out all opposition while richly rewarding those who swear fealty.\n\n**Warrior Cult**. Cultists of Bane are warriors who wear heavy armor and wield maces, swords, spears, and crossbows. They paint the right gauntlet of their armor black in honor of their patron. Bane’s clerics wield black maces with heads shaped to look like a closed fist.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Bane’s cultists operate according to strict military hierarchies. The lowest rank consists of the ***fists of Bane***, foot soldiers who obey all orders without hesitation. They are led by iron consuls, cunning field officers who excel at coordinating the fists in combat. The black gauntlets are the priests who command the consuls.",

          "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. **Reapers** are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the death’s heads, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

          "Description": "Cultists of the Dead Three\n-\n\nThe Dead Three are evil adventurers named Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul who long ago quested to become gods. They succeeded but grew even more ambitious. They tried to seize the Tablets of Fate from the overgod Ao and use them to rule over Faerûn and its gods. They failed and were slain during the Time of Troubles. Since then, a variety of contingency plans they had in place allowed them to be reborn.\n\nWhile the Sundering saw the other gods of the Forgotten Realms withdraw their direct influence from the world, the Dead Three remained behind in mortal form as quasi-divine beings. While their power has diminished, they remain a formidable trio and play a malevolent role in influencing events on Faerûn.\n\n**Bane and His Followers**\n\nBane is a god of tyranny, and both he and his worshipers seek to rule the world. Bane grants power to those who strive to rule with an iron fist. By imposing order on the world, Bane’s followers ensure that those who are clever, strong, and ambitious rise to the top while the weak languish in slavery.\n\nRegardless of the form he takes, Bane is always marked by his jet-black right hand. He usually wears a gauntlet or glove over this hand to conceal his identity, revealing it only when the time has come to display his true power. He is always well-dressed, donning the fine clothing of a noble or wearing the armor and gear of a successful mercenary general. His preferred weapon is a mace.\n\nBane overpowers those who display any weakness, bullying them into submission or crushing them with his physical and magical power.

          "Description": "Bhaal and His Followers\n-\n\nBhaal is a god of murder who lends power to those whose killings invoke fear and dread. The act of murder is only half the equation. The second half is the suspicion, paranoia, and fear that a seemingly unstoppable killer can evoke. Bhaal seeks to inspire fear by slaying those seemingly beyond the reach of death.\n\nBhaal always carries a red handkerchief somewhere on his person. He can take on an alternate appearance regardless of his current form, that of a hulking brute armed with a long, curved dagger that drips blood. In this form, he wears only a tattered loin cloth, is hairless, and is covered with bleeding wounds caused by a slashing blade. His face is a skull flayed of its flesh and surrounded by a halo of blood.\n\nBhaal is a vicious bully who enjoys killing people in gruesome ways. He’s brought to heel only by the combination of Bane and Myrkul.\n\nBhaal’s cultists emulate their deity, carrying out gruesome murders to spread fear and horror. They are charming and disarming when they wish, but in combat their true, bloodthirsty nature comes to the fore.\n\n**Bloodletters**. All cultists of Bhaal learn to call upon their god’s power to leave their victims vulnerable to their long-bladed knives. When Bhaal’s magic works its power, stab wounds erupt in terrible gouts of blood. Seemingly minor wounds plunge deep into a victim’s body and cause terrible pain and bleeding.\n\n**Killers from the Shadows**. Bhaal’s followers are cunning murderers who kill to strike fear and thrive on sowing terror in the cities they inhabit. They can call upon their god’s power to blend into the shadows with ease, or even turn invisible for a crucial moment.\n\n**Cult Ranks**. Low-ranking cultists of Bhaal are called night blades, whom Bhaal blesses with darkvision and superior stealth. Reapers are the next rank up. They gain the ability to turn invisible and can use Bhaal’s magic to evade suspicion. The highest rank are the **death’s heads**, who can take on the skull-faced guise of their deity to terrify their prey. In combat, they intimidate foes by shrugging off the deadliest attacks with ease, showing that resisting Bhaal’s schemes is futile.",

It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components: At will: misty step, shield; 1/day each: dominate monster, levitate.\n\n4 - Terrifying: The corrupted ogre chieftain's body is covered in horns, eyes, and fanged maws.
